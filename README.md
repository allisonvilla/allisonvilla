### 😊 Hi there! I'm Allison, a front end developer.

👩‍💻 What I'm working on lately:
- A gratitude journal built with Vue.js and Firebase (to get familiar with Vue and learn a new technology)
- Studying an intro computer science course, [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/ "CS50")

📚 What I'd like to learn next:
- Unit testing
- TypeScript
- React Redux
